# intern--task-4

Task 1 of the cyber security interniship by Elevate labs is to learn about working of firewall and perform basic rules to allow or block traffic

I learnt what a firewall is and how it works in a practical case and leart to perfrom add or delete basic rules to allow or block taffic. I used UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) tool to allow or block traffic. With the help of this tool, i could now add rules, delete rules, add specific ip to allow in, etc. 

On completing this task, I am now confident in the concept of firewall and perfrom basic rules to allow or block traffic.
